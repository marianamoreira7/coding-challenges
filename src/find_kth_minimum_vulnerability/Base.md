Note 📝 - Another problem related to find server vulnerability Find Least Possible Vulnerability 🦥

Amazon Web Services has n servers where the ith server's vulnerability score is vulnerability[i]. A client wants to deploy their application on a group of m contiguous servers. The vulnerability of a group is defined as the kth minimum vulnerability among the chosen servers. Find the vulnerability of each possible group of m contiguous servers the client can choose.

Function Description

Complete the function findKthMinimumVulnerability in the editor below.

findKthMinimumVulnerability has the following parameter(s):

int k: the order of the vulnerability to find
int m: the number of servers in a group
int vulnerability[n]: the vulnerabilities of each server
Returns

int[]: the vulnerabilities for each group, in order

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, m = 3, vulnerability = [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation:

There are 2 contiguous groups of m = 3 servers: [1, 3, 2] and [3, 2, 1].

The k = 2ndnd lowest vulnerability in each group is 2.

Return the answers for each group, in order: [2, 2].

Example 2:

Input: k = 3, m = 4, vulnerability = [4, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output: [3, 2]
Explanation:

No explanation's found so far. If you happen to know about it. You're more than welcome to lmk! Many thanks in advance! 🧡

Constraints:
1 <= k <= m <= n <= 3*10^5
1 <= vulnerability[i] <= 10^9
